"python runSim.py" should run the simulation.
	
"python runSim.py -g" will run it on the SUMO GUI.

"python runSim.py -v" includes step-by-step info on position and speed.

"python runSims.py n" runs a simulation n times and stores the output in the Results folder.
	
Change the SUMO configuration by changing the line CONFIGNAME="this.sumocfg" in runSim.py

To change the model used for each car, change its type in the .rou file.  Ex: changing veh1 in collide1.rou to type "npc" will make it stay far away from the other car.
